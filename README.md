Java program which explores Evolutionary Computation (mutation/selection) in an attempt to find the minimum output of a mystery function. 

The mystery function is included in the project files but needs to be added to the build path as an external JAR.

The mystery function takes in an array of doubles (array can be of any size) and the goal is to find the smallest output possible as to
determine the global minimum.
